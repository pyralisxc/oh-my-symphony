"""SPEC §11.1 — tracker adapter contract and factory.

Every tracker adapter MUST implement these operations and return normalized
`Issue` objects (§4.1.1). Transport details are adapter-defined.

Adapters live as submodules:

    symphony.trackers.file    -> FileBoardTracker  (Markdown ticket files)
    symphony.trackers.linear  -> LinearClient      (Linear GraphQL)
    symphony.trackers.jira    -> JiraClient        (Jira Cloud REST API v3)\n    symphony.trackers.github  -> GitHubClient      (GitHub Issues REST API)

        evaluates ``Issue.description`` for required sections at every
