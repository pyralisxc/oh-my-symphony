"""SPEC §4.1.3, §6.4 — frozen typed config view exposed to the orchestrator.

Every field a long-running workflow can carry — tracker, hooks, backend
kind configs, TUI/server/progress/system/wiki extras, prompt template
overrides — lives here as a `@dataclass(frozen=True)` value type. The
builder (`build_service_config`) is the only writer; the orchestrator and
TUI only read.

`ServiceConfig.prompt_template_for_state` and `backend_timeouts` are the
small handful of methods kept on the value types because they project
state-local views (per-state prompts, active-backend timeouts) that
otherwise would force every caller to recompute the same `if/elif` ladder.
